## Types

The following types are available. Numeric types in javascript are checked to be within limits, before sent over websocket.

```
.ango    go       angular   description
string   string   string    A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes.

uint8    uint8    number    The set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16   uint16   number    The set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32   uint32   number    The set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64   uint64   number    The set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8     int8     number    The set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16    int16    number    The set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32    int32    number    The set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64    int64    number    The set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32  float32  number    The set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64  float64  number    The set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

IDEA: provide bytes as base64 string. `type GongBytes []byte` with MarshalJSON.. etc. functions..
bytes    []byte   string-base64? array with chars?
If base64 encoding/decoding is required: http://play.golang.org/p/2FJllMmHk1

### TODO:
 - "anything" as parameter types (presented as object in ng/js and as interface{} in go).

 or

 - typed objects/arrays, definition in specs types generated by ango
